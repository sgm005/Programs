 
Welcome to my Python Projects repository. In this collection, you’ll find some small but practical Python projects I’ve been working on to build my skills. Each project solves a real-world problem or automates a task, ranging from a password generator to a web scraper.



What's Inside
1. Password Generator
A simple password generator where you can customize the length and choose whether you want uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. I also built a graphical interface using Tkinter to make it easy to use.

2. Web Scraper
This project uses BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape data from websites. It can be easily adapted for different sites and data needs. Handy for quickly grabbing information from the web.

3. Basic Calculator
A basic calculator for simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Includes error handling to prevent invalid input.

4. File Organizer
A script that organizes files in a directory based on file type (e.g., PDFs, images, etc.). It’s perfect for cleaning up a cluttered folder quickly and efficiently.

Why I Made These Projects
Practical Focus: These projects are all designed to solve everyday problems, from managing passwords to scraping data.
Clean Code: I’ve paid attention to writing clean, easy-to-read, and maintainable code.
Continuous Learning: These projects reflect my learning process as I continue to explore Python and improve my skills.
